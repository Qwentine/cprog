Homework #1

Write a "multiplatform" program which shows the compiler and the operating system used to compile the program. The program refuses to compile if no known compiler found.

Hints:
Use the conditional compilation. 

The code does not have to be too complex, just pick a few compilers/OSs to demonstrate the principles (the one You use and at least one more). Be sure to include GCC/Linux.

Homework #2

Write a program which computes the the volume and surface of some basic geometrical objects(cube, sphere, cylinder). Separate the source into several .c/.h files one for each object.

Hints:
Do not bother with entering the data by user. The dimensions can be hard-coded, but use a separate header file for it.
Do the upper using at least two of following methods:
 1. Manual compile command
 2. make+Makefile
 3. Your favourite IDE

Homework #3

(1)
Write a function:

*int SumArrays(int *arr1,int *arr2,  int dim1,int dim2)

the function takes two arrays(by references) of integers(+ their dimmensions) and creates one new dynamic array which will contain the summation of those arrays. Write a simple program to demonstrate the work of the function.

(2)
Create a structure named "PointInSpace" able to hold coordinates of one point in three dimmensional space. Write a function that will be able to move that point in space (by given x,z,y).

write the function:
1- that will take the point(structure) by value and retunrn the structure of same type
2- that will take the point by reference and put the result in the original point
