Homework #1

Write a "multiplatform" program which shows the compiler and the operating system used to compile the program. The program refuses to compile if no known compiler found.

Hints:
Use the conditional compilation. 

The code does not have to be too complex, just pick a few compilers/OSs to demonstrate the principles (the one You use and at least one more). Be sure to include GCC/Linux.
