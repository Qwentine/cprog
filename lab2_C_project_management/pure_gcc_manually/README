//multifile project example, manually

//command to compile the project manually:

user@machine$ gcc module1.c module2.c differnet_file.c main.c -o program.bin

//stands for Unix/Linux compiler GCC 
//by the above command we get binary executable file program.bin
//run by:
user@machine$ ./program.bin

//the “project management” is done here simply by enumerating all the files which need to be included in compilation
