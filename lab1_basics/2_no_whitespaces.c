#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){printf("Hello World\n");return 2;}

//white spaces and other non-printable characters are just for lucidity (for readers) but compiler does not care about them 
//well it cares a little at the end, white spaces are used as keywords separators and also there has to be a newline at the end of preprocessor directives
// int main(){...}  ok
// intmain(){...} wrong
